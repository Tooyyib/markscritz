<h1><u>Hi,I'm Marc</u></h1>
<b>
<P>...and i work for the next generation of makers.</P>
</b>
<p><u>Tech</u> is reshaping how we learn and come together.
   Software is ubiquitious and every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them.
 However, today's world isn't designed to 
 work for these makers creating an imbalance between the impact they're capable of, and
  what's expected of them.</p>

<p>I'm working to solve this problem…</p>

<p>by creating better tools at Sdui for education and formerly at Hackerbay for hackers and companies;
by building communities, formerly as co-founder of Hackevents organizing hackathons across Germany,
 now by mentoring at hackathons around the world;
…and through one commit at a time.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working as Head of Engineering at Sdui. 
  It's an amazing gig where I get to work alongside great developers on
   a software product that has become an integral medium upon which tens of thousands of teachers,
   parents and students rely to guarantee essential communication.</p>

<p>I'm currently living in <b>Helsinki, Finland.</b>
   Some other places I've lived in are Berlin, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Munich.</p>

<p>I'm a huge physics nerd, in particular cosmology. I wrote about the accelerating expansion of the universe, 
  or better know as Dark Energy here.</p>

<p>Previously,
I founded and built <u>Hackerbay</u> as <b>CTO</b> with three awesome friends.
 We took a small insight from hackathons-software is not a 12 month development cycle and built up a B2B company. 
 We worked with <u>Twitter, Vodafone, Allianz</u> and some of Germany's largest corporations.
<b>NFX</b> we had incredible investors on board and always an open ear from <b>James, Peter, or Gigi.</b></p>

<p>After five years of immense personal and professional growth, 
  priorities changed and we decided to pursue new opportunities,
   where each of our personal strengths are best put to use.</p>

<p>For me that's building tools for enabling the next billion developers.</p>
